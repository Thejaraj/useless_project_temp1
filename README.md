# [emoji game] 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Zen

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Keerthana - CUSAT
- Member 2: Theja - CUSAT

### Project Description
This is a fun interactive Emoji Movie Guesser game where users enter emojis representing a movie, and the app tries to guess its name from a built-in emoji-to-movie database. It features a colorful animated UI, floating emojis, and special effects like confetti for correct answers.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Apparently, people everywhere are suffering from the inability to communicate movie names without using words—tragic, I know. This app heroically solves that “problem” by letting you speak the universal language of emojis, so you can finally tell your friends you watched Titanic using 🚢💔🌊 instead of boring old letters.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By building the world’s most unnecessarily fabulous Emoji Movie Guesser—a glittery, animated playground where you type cryptic emoji combos, and our code magically shouts the movie name back at you with confetti, floating popcorn, and way more enthusiasm than anyone asked for.


## Technical Details

## Team Contributions
- **Keerthana:** Designed the emoji database, created the floating emoji animation, and added confetti logic that occasionally goes a little too wild.
- **Theja:** Wrote the JavaScript guessing logic, debugged “emoji misinterpretations,” and made sure 🚀 doesn’t mean “Interstellar” every time.
